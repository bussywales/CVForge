## What CVForge is
CVForge keeps your job applications, evidence, exports, practice sessions, and activity logging together in a single workspace. It tracks role-fit signals, lets you choose which experience proves each gap, builds ATS‑friendly CVs/cover letters, and helps you practise STAR answers. Everything stays deterministic: you review each change, approve evidence, and push updates on demand.

## Apply in 20 minutes
1. **Overview tab** – tidy the job details and job advert; paste text if fetch is blocked so Role Fit has a solid base.
2. **Evidence tab** – spot your gaps, select matching achievements/work-history bullets, and toggle evidence targets (CV, cover, STAR) so exports and interviews share the same proof.
3. **Apply tab** – generate an Autopack, complete the Smart Apply checklist, export ATS-minimal CV + cover, and download the Application Kit ZIP.
4. **Interview tab** – practise the weakest question, open Drill Mode, and generate Answer Pack variants (Standard + 90-second) for practice drafts.
5. **Activity tab** – log the latest touchpoint, set the next action due, and use outreach templates when needed.
**Next:** follow one of the Common paths below to keep the engine humming.

## By-tab workflows
- **Overview**: edit the job/ad details, paste relative text, use “Open & paste” when fetch is blocked, and keep the collapsible form tidy.
  - Next: refresh the job advert whenever data changes so Role Fit is accurate.
- **Evidence**: select gap evidence, pick which outputs (CV/cover/STAR) need each clip, and rely on the STAR Library for drafts.
  - Next: make sure each gap has a selected item before touching an autopack.
- **Apply**: view the Smart Apply checklist, mark exports, download the kit, and regenerate autopacks when evidence changes.
  - Next: export ATS-minimal for submission, Standard for humans.
- **Interview**: Interview Lift suggests actions, the Interview Pack + Practice Dashboard feed Drill Mode, and Answer Pack gives ready-to-copy responses.
  - Next: drill a low-score question, copy the 90-second answer, and log the practice under Activity.
- **Activity**: record calls, follow-ups, interviews; set next_action_due; share outreach templates; ICS download keeps reminders handy.
  - Next: keep the Activity badge green by logging every touchpoint.
- **Admin/Debug**: delete applications or check low-use controls without cluttering daily workflows.
  - Next: tidy admin only once a role is archived.

## Optional AI Boost (Rewrite Coach)
Use Rewrite Coach when you already drafted a STAR answer and need cleaner structure or stronger metrics. The coach rewrites based on your words; you stay in control, compare versions, and paste the improved text back into Practice.
1. Draft your STAR answer in Practice.
2. Tap Score to see the rubric.
3. Hit Rewrite Coach to generate the polished version.
4. Compare the original vs improved text.
5. Apply the improved answer back into your practice draft.
**Next:** only use Rewrite Coach after adding evidence, and double-check all inserted placeholders ([X], [Y]) before saving.

## Common paths
- **Applying today**: Overview → Evidence → Apply checklist → Activity (mark submitted).
- **Building profile this week**: iterate Evidence → STAR Library → Practice → Smart Apply readiness.
- **Interview prep**: Interview tab → Drill Mode → Answer Pack, then log practice and add follow-up reminders.
- **Following up**: Activity + Outreach templates → schedule next_action_due → record outreach in the log.
**Next:** jot down the path you followed and keep the same checklist for the next job.

## Common issues and how to recover
| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Job link fetch fails | Indeed/LinkedIn block bots | Open advert, paste text manually, keep the link in case you need to refer back |
| STAR Library shows zero | No STAR-target evidence selected | Pick the STAR-labelled evidence item in the Evidence tab first |
| Evidence suggestions weak | Missing keywords/metrics in achievements | Add achievements/work-history bullets with the gap keywords and measurable metrics |
| Smart Apply checklist stuck | No autopack export yet | Generate/autopack and export the CV + cover + interview pack, then mark checklist items done |
**Next:** hit the relevant fix before moving on to the next section.

## Best practices
- Keep **metrics ≤120 characters**, include percentages/time, and avoid filler.
- Keep **achievements atomic** so you can reuse them for multiple gaps.
- Use **work history bullets** for operational duties, achievements for impact.
- Default to **ATS-minimal** for submission, use Standard when emailing PDFs later.
**Next:** revisit metrics after each application to stay sharp.

## Which export should I use
- **ATS-minimal**: online applications and ATS forms where clean, plain bullet structure matters.
- **Standard**: recruiter conversations, PDF reviews, or any time you need a richer layout.
**Next:** choose ATS-minimal before you hit submit, switch to Standard when sharing with humans.

## What CVForge does/doesn't do
CVForge stores applications, job advert snapshots, evidence, STAR drafts, and activity logs; it does not auto-send emails or scrape third-party sites beyond the manual fetch you initiate.
It does not invent stories: you select the evidence, approve the Rewrite Coach suggestions, and keep every export deterministic.
**Next:** remind your team that CVForge keeps you in control—no automatic submissions.
