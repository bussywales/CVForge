# CVForge User Guide v1.2 (for non-technical users)

CVForge helps you turn a job advert into a *submission-ready* CV + cover letter + interview answers — using **deterministic** guidance (clear rules, not magic). You stay in control: you choose evidence, approve changes, and exports are sanitised.

## What CVForge is
CVForge is your job-application workspace. For each application, it helps you:
- bring the job advert in (paste or fetch where allowed),
- highlight what the advert is asking for (Role Fit),
- match your own experience (Evidence Engine),
- generate clean exports (CV + cover, Standard or ATS-Minimal),
- prepare for interviews (STAR drafts, Practice/Drill Mode, Answer Pack),
- track follow-ups and next actions (Activity + Outreach Engine),
- download a complete submission bundle (Application Kit ZIP).

It is designed to increase interview rate by enforcing the basics recruiters and ATS systems reward: **relevance, evidence, measurable outcomes, and consistency**.

---

## Apply in 20 minutes (quick path)
If you are applying *right now*, do this in order:

1. **Overview tab** → add/paste the job description and job link.
2. **Evidence tab** → pick 1–3 gaps and select best-matching evidence (aim for “Good/Strong” matches).
3. Still in **Evidence tab** → set targets to CV ✅, Cover ✅, STAR ✅ (when practising/interviewing soon).
4. **Apply tab** → generate an Autopack, export ATS-Minimal CV + cover, and download the Application Kit ZIP.
5. **Activity tab** → log “Submitted” or your real status and set the next follow-up date.

**Rule of thumb:** If time is short, select strong evidence for the top gaps before exporting.

---

## Optional AI Boost workflow (Rewrite Coach)
Rewrite Coach is optional. Use it **after** you’ve written a draft and selected evidence.

Best use:
- You already have a STAR draft but want clearer structure and tighter metrics.

Flow:
1. Write your draft answer (your own words).
2. Score it (deterministic rubric).
3. Use Rewrite Coach to generate an improved version.
4. Compare original vs improved.
5. Apply the improved version only if it’s accurate.

**Important:** Review placeholders like [X], [Y] and remove anything untrue before saving/exporting.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What it means | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Job fetch fails (Indeed/LinkedIn) | Those sites block automated fetches | Open the job advert in your browser, copy the JD, paste it into the JD field |
| “No matching evidence found” | Your achievements/work history lack the right keywords or metrics | Add bullets that mention the gap terms/metrics; refresh Role Fit |
| STAR Library shows 0 | No STAR-targeted evidence selected | Choose the STAR-labelled evidence item before creating a draft |
| Apply checklist stays pending | No autopack exported yet | Generate an autopack, export CV/Cover/Interview Pack, then mark checklist items |

**Next:** fix the specific issue before continuing along your chosen path.

---

## Best practices
- Keep **metrics ≤120 characters** with scale (people, %, time, £).
- Make **achievements atomic** (one impact per entry).
- Use **work history bullets** for responsibilities, achievements for impact.
- Export choice: ATS-Minimal for online forms, Standard for recruiter review.

**Next:** revisit your metrics after each application.

---

## Which export should I use
- **ATS-Minimal**: online applications/ATS forms where plain bullets win.
- **Standard**: recruiter emails, PDFs, or richer formatting.

**Next:** default to ATS-Minimal when submitting, Standard when sharing with humans.

---

## What CVForge does and doesn’t do
**Does store**: applications, pasted job descriptions, allowed fetched snapshots, evidence selections, STAR drafts, practice answers, activity logs.
**Doesn’t do**: auto-send applications, invent experience, or bypass blocked sites (it guides you to paste manually).

**Next:** remind collaborators that CVForge keeps control in your hands.

---

## Privacy and data handling
- CVForge stores the data you enter: applications, job advert snapshots (where allowed), evidence, STAR drafts, practice answers, activities.
- Opt-in learning (if enabled) only captures anonymised terms; practise answers and STAR drafts stay with your account.

**Next:** review privacy if you change teams or workspace ownership.
