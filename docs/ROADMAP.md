# Roadmap

## Now

### Role Fit
Outcome: keep Role Fit reliable for any job with deterministic signals and gap guidance.
Scope boundary: core/domain packs, fallback terms, and UI guidance only.
Success criteria: non-zero coverage on typical JDs and clear, actionable gaps.
Not in scope: LLM scoring, external scraping, or auto-writing CV content.

### Pipeline and tracking
Outcome: a consistent view of status, next actions, and follow-up dates.
Scope boundary: status updates, activity logging, and reminders with ICS downloads.
Success criteria: users can see due/overdue items and log activity in one flow.
Not in scope: email sending, background notifications, or CRM integrations.

### Imports and exports
Outcome: stable DOCX import preview/apply and professional DOCX exports.
Scope boundary: DOCX only, two export variants, ZIP submission packs.
Success criteria: export quality meets ATS expectations and import applies cleanly.
Not in scope: PDF export or file storage.

## Next

### JD learning
Outcome: grow Role Fit coverage via opt-in, anonymised JD signals.
Scope boundary: redacted terms only, admin review and publishing.
Success criteria: new packs published safely and improve gap relevance.
Not in scope: storing raw JDs or auto-publishing without review.

### Interview Lift
Outcome: raise interview conversion with deterministic next actions and STAR drafts.
Scope boundary: heuristics from Role Fit and CV content, no AI rewriting.
Success criteria: lift prompts appear after activity and are acted upon.
Not in scope: automated coaching or personalised prompts via LLMs.

## Later

### Outreach Engine
Outcome: repeatable, logged follow-up sequences per application.
Scope boundary: deterministic templates, copy-only, activity logging.
Success criteria: users can log outreach and schedule follow-ups quickly.
Not in scope: email delivery, messaging integrations, or automation.

### Billing and credits
Outcome: predictable credit purchase and usage tracking.
Scope boundary: Stripe checkout, webhook crediting, credit ledger.
Success criteria: credits are accurate and generation is gated correctly.
Not in scope: subscriptions, invoices, or team billing.
